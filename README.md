Learning HTML and Creating My First Website
Introduction
When I first started learning HTML, I was excited to dive into the world of web development. As a food lover, I decided to create a website that would hold all my favorite recipes in one place. I began by learning the basics of HTML, such as creating paragraphs, headings, and lists.

Creating My Recipe List
Once I felt comfortable with the basics, I started creating my recipe list. I used an unordered list to hold the ingredients for each recipe, and an ordered list to hold the steps. I made sure to include the name of the recipe and a brief description to entice my visitors.

Adding Images
To make my recipe list more visually appealing, I added images of each dish. I first located images online that I had permission to use, or took my own pictures of the dishes. Then, I added the images to my HTML code using the <img> tag. I made sure to include the alt attribute with a brief description of the image for accessibility purposes.

Using Unordered Lists for Ingredients and Ordered Lists for Steps
Using unordered lists for ingredients and ordered lists for steps made it easy for visitors to follow along with each recipe. I listed the ingredients in the order they would be used, so visitors could easily see what they needed and when. For the steps, I listed them in order, so visitors could follow along and create the recipe with ease.

Conclusion
Learning HTML and creating my first website was a fun and fulfilling experience. By combining my love for food with my desire to learn HTML, I was able to create something that I am proud of. Using unordered lists for ingredients and ordered lists for steps made my recipe list easy to read and follow. Adding images made my website more visually appealing and engaging. I am excited to continue improving my website and learning new skills in web development.
