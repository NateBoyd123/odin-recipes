    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the macaroni according to package instructions until al dente.
        Drain and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Whisk in the
        flour and cook for 1-2 minutes until smooth and bubbly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gradually add the milk to the saucepan, whisking constantly to prevent
        lumps. Stir in the Dijon mustard, garlic powder, paprika, and cayenne
        pepper (if using).
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the sauce, stirring frequently, until it thickens and coats the
        back of a spoon, about 10-15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in 3 cups of the grated
        cheddar cheese until melted and smooth.
      </li>
      <li>Season the cheese sauce with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
      <li>Add the cooked macaroni to the cheese sauce and stir to combine.</li>
      <li>Transfer the mac and cheese mixture to the greased baking dish.</li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle the remaining 1 cup of grated cheddar cheese over the top of
        the mac and cheese. If using, sprinkle breadcrumbs on top of the cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake the mac and cheese for 25-30 minutes or until the cheese is melted
        and bubbly and the top is golden brown and crispy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the mac and cheese from the oven and let it cool for a few
        minutes before serving. If desired, garnish with chopped fresh parsley
        before serving.
