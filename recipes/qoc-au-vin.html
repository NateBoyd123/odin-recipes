    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Coq au Vin is a classic French dish that consists of chicken cooked in a
      red wine sauce with vegetables and bacon. This complex dinner idea
      involves braising chicken thighs and drumsticks in red wine and chicken
      broth for an hour until the meat is fall-off-the-bone tender. The dish is
      then enriched with diced bacon, sautéed onions, garlic, carrots, and
      celery, which add layers of flavor and complexity to the dish. The sauce
      is thickened with a tablespoon of tomato paste and simmered for another
      10-15 minutes until it reaches the desired consistency.
    </p>
    <p>
      To complement the rich flavors of the Coq au Vin, this meal is served with
      garlic mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables. The mashed potatoes are
      made by boiling potatoes until they are fork-tender, then mashing them
      with butter, cream, and roasted garlic for an extra depth of flavor. The
      roasted vegetables can be any combination of seasonal vegetables, such as
      brussels sprouts, carrots, and parsnips, tossed with olive oil, salt, and
      pepper, and roasted in the oven until caramelized and tender. The
      combination of tender braised chicken, rich red wine sauce, creamy garlic
      mashed potatoes, and roasted vegetables creates a truly delicious and
      sophisticated meal that is perfect for a special occasion or a weekend
      dinner with family and friends.

      <li>8 ounces thick-cut bacon, diced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>2 cups red wine</li>

      <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
      <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
      <li>3 carrots, chopped</li>
      <li>3 celery stalks, chopped</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon thyme leaves</li>
      <li>1 bay leaf</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
      <li>Garlic mashed potatoes (potatoes, butter, cream, roasted garlic)</li>
      <li>
        Roasted vegetables (such as brussels sprouts, carrots, and parsnips)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
      <li>
        In a large Dutch oven or heavy pot, cook the diced bacon over medium
        heat until crispy, about 8-10 minutes. Remove the bacon with a slotted
        spoon and set aside, leaving the bacon fat in the pot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the olive oil to the pot and heat over medium-high heat. Season the
        chicken thighs and drumsticks with salt and pepper, then add them to the
        pot and cook until browned on all sides, about 6-8 minutes. Remove the
        chicken from the pot and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the chopped onions, garlic, carrots, and celery to the pot and cook
        until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and cook for
        another minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the red wine, chicken broth, thyme leaves, and bay leaf to the pot,
        scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Return the
        chicken and bacon to the pot and bring the mixture to a simmer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the pot and transfer it to the preheated oven. Bake for 1 hour or
        until the chicken is cooked through and tender.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the Coq au Vin is cooking, prepare the garlic mashed potatoes.
        Boil potatoes until fork-tender, then mash them with butter, cream, and
        roasted garlic until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare the roasted vegetables by tossing them with olive oil, salt, and
        pepper, and roasting in the oven until caramelized and tender.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the Coq au Vin is done, remove the pot from the oven and let it
        rest for a few minutes before serving. Serve the chicken with the red
        wine sauce, garlic mashed potatoes, and roasted vegetables.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <em>Note that the garlic mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables are prepared
      separately from the Coq au Vin and are not included in the steps for
      making the dish.</em>
